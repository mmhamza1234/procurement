**COMPREHENSIVE WEEKLY OIL & GAS NEWSLETTER GENERATION PROMPT**

***

**USER CONTEXT:**

<topic>Weekly Oil & Gas information-only bullets for TWO editions:

(1) Principals Edition (OEM partners such as Boldrocchi, Air Products, Veolia).

(2) Egyptian Clients Edition (operators and EGPC/EGAS ecosystem) — includes light Global and Regional sections before Egypt.</topic>

<scope>Last 7 days, cutoff every Monday 08:00 Africa/Cairo.</scope>

<audience>Professional readers (executives, technical managers, owners/shareholders).</audience>

***

**RESEARCH & DATA GATHERING TASKS (do in order):**

1) **Historical Analysis:** Read any "Previous Issues" appended after this prompt (see PAST ISSUES block). Extract prior headlines to avoid exact duplication. Only mark "Update:" if a story materially advanced (e.g., bid → award, FID taken, volumes revised).

2) **Source Research:** Research developments within the last 7 days using authoritative sources: Argus, MEES, Reuters Oil, Platts, Upstream Online, company PRs, EGPC/EGAS/EEHC releases, SEC/EGX filings, GCC tender portals, LinkedIn posts. For rig counts use Baker Hughes (global) and TAM Oil or Egypt Oil & Gas (Egypt).

3) **Content Compilation:** Compile bullets for TWO editions with the same Egypt sections but different prefaces:
   -  Principals Edition: Egypt-only sections.
   -  Egyptian Clients Edition: Market Snapshot, then light Global and Regional sections, then the Egypt sections.

4) **Principals Edition Emphasis:** Opportunities matching OEM lines (air-cooled exchangers, fans, compressors, emissions/water/H₂). When relevant, add "OEM match: …" and include owner, scope, stage (RFI/RFQ/award), and bid/close dates if available.

5) **Egyptian Clients Edition Emphasis:** Policy/regulatory circulars, gas/electricity pricing, load curtailment notices, operational outages/restorations at fields/refineries, supply/demand, and state-owned company updates.

6) **Editorial Guidelines:** Minimize Israel-related deal coverage; include only if essential to Egypt. If included, place it as the last bullet in its section and keep wording strictly factual.

7) **Content Standards:** Facts only. No forecasts/opinions. USD only (no EGP). Brent only (no WTI or crude grade deep-dives). All timestamps in Africa/Cairo. Inline links only (no footnotes).

-  **Global Rig Counts:** Oil-only and total (oil+gas) — latest available, timestamp + Baker Hughes link.
-  **Egypt Rig Counts:** Oil-only and total — latest available, timestamp + TAM Oil or Egypt Oil & Gas link.
(Do not mention Egyptian crude grade types.)

***

**PER-ITEM BULLET FORMAT (Sections after Market Snapshot):**

Each bullet ≤50 words and must contain, where available:
-  **Headline** (concise) — inline source link (primary; add a second reputable source only if needed).
-  **Timestamp** (Africa/Cairo).
-  **One-line takeaway** with key numbers (bbl/d, mmscf/d, kt/y; capacity; CAPEX USD; timeline/milestones; location/concession).
-  **Counterparties** (owner/operator/EPC/EPCM/contractors).
-  **For tenders/projects:** entity, tender ID, scope & key specs, submission deadline, pre-bid/site visit dates, stage (RFI/RFQ/award). Add "OEM match: …" when relevant (Principals Edition).

***

**BULLET COUNTS & FILL RULES:**

-  **Egypt sections:** exactly 7 bullets per section.
-  **Clients Edition extras:** Global = 3 bullets; Regional = 3 bullets.
-  **If fewer qualifying items exist** in the 7-day window, append "Context:" bullets (clearly labeled) using items older than 7 days that are directly relevant to an active Egypt development (e.g., pending award).
-  **Deduplication:** Apply across all sections and both editions. Use "Update:" only on material change.

***

**SOURCES & QUALITY STANDARDS:**

-  **Primary sources preferred:** Official releases, filings. Otherwise use Argus/MEES/Reuters/Platts/Upstream.
-  **Brent price:** Reputable market data source from the list above, with explicit timestamp.
-  **Rig counts:** Baker Hughes (global); TAM Oil or Egypt Oil & Gas (Egypt). Latest figures only; do not compute WoW/YoY deltas.
-  **Data quality:** If data is weak/unclear, state "insufficient data" and skip.

**Market Snapshot:**
