**RESEARCH & DATA GATHERING TASKS (do in order):**

1) **Historical Analysis:** Read any "Previous Issues" appended after this prompt (see PAST ISSUES block). Extract prior headlines to avoid duplication. Only mark "Update:" if a story materially advanced (e.g., RFP → award, financial close signed, scope expanded, ridership/tariff revised).

2) **Source Research (Transportation-specific):** Research developments within the last 7 days using authoritative sources:

   **Egypt official:** Ministry of Transport (MoT), NAT (Cairo Metro/Monorail), ENR, Cairo Transport Authority (CTA), Suez Canal Authority (SCA), Egyptian Cabinet decisions, CAPMAS, General Authority for Roads, Bridges & Land Transport (GARBLT), Alexandria/Port Said/Damietta Port Authorities, GAFI tenders.

   **Project/tender & filings:** Egyptian Government e-tenders portal, EGX/SEC/ADGM filings of contractors (Orascom Construction, Hassan Allam, Arab Contractors, Elsewedy Electric, etc.).

   **Global/industry:** Railway Gazette, International Railway Journal (IRJ), UITP, MEED, Zawya, Reuters MENA, IATA (aviation stats as relevant), Drewry (container index as relevant).

   **Company PRs & LinkedIn** (operators, EPCs, OEMs).
   Use official or tier-1 industry sources for fares/tariffs and policy.

3) **Content Compilation:** Compile bullets for TWO editions with the same Egypt sections but different prefaces:

   -  Principals Edition: Egypt-only sections.
   -  Egyptian Clients Edition: Market Snapshot, then Global (3) and Regional (3), then the Egypt sections.

4) **Principals Edition Emphasis:** Opportunities matching OEM lines (rolling stock, signaling, CBTC/ETCS, electrification & substations, AFC/fare media, PSD, SCADA/telecoms, depots, track/turnouts, bridges & civils, O&M). When relevant, add "OEM match: …" and include owner, scope, stage (RFI/RFQ/award), and bid/close dates if available.

5) **Egyptian Clients Edition Emphasis:** Policy/tariffs, fare changes, ridership/service notices, maintenance outages/restorations, road & bridge packages, port & logistics throughput, Suez Canal updates impacting supply chains, and state-owned company updates.

6) **Editorial Guidelines:** Keep coverage Egypt-centric. Include Israel-related items only if essential to Egypt's transport/logistics; if included, place as the last bullet in its section and keep wording strictly factual.

7) **Content Standards:** Facts only. No forecasts/opinions. All timestamps in Africa/Cairo. Inline links only (no footnotes). Currency: use EGP for domestic fares/tariffs; USD for project capex/contracts and international references.

Each bullet ≤ 50 words and must contain, where available:

-  **Headline** (concise) — inline source link (primary; add a second reputable source only if needed).

-  **Deduplication:** Apply across all sections and both editions. Use "Update:" only on material change.

***
