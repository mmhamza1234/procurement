TASKS (do in order):
1. Decompose the topic into sub-questions. Think step-by-step.  
2. For each sub-question, search reputable databases (industry reports, vendor directories, academic OCR papers, trade registries). List top 5 findings with source links.  
3. Evaluate evidence quality (sample size, recency, conflicts).  
4. Synthesise insights into a concise, plain-English report.

OUTPUT FORMAT (exactly):
{
  "executive_summary": "<150-word punchy recap>",
  "key_findings": [
    { "claim": "...", "evidence": "...", "confidence": "%", "citation": "URL" }
  ],
  "gaps_future_work": "bullet list",
  "references": ["APA-style citations …"]
}

CONSTRAINTS:
- Prefer sources ≤ Aug 5 2025.  
- Use bullet lists where possible.  
- Ensure the compiled supplier database contains **≥100 unique companies** and satisfies all regional & category minimums.  
- Do not omit any requirement listed above.  
- If evidence is weak, state "insufficient data" rather than guessing.
